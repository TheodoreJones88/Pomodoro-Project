# Pomodoro-Project
This is a react app that I build the backend logic for. It operates exactly like the pomodoro technique.

## Project Explaination
The Pomodoro technique is when you focus on doing a task for anywhere from 5-25 minutes and then break anywhere from 1-15 minutes. The focus time must increment by 5 minutes only and the break can increment up or down by 1 minute only.
Once the focus time is up then an alarm sounds and the break time starts. Once the break time stops the same alarm plays and then the focus timer starts.
